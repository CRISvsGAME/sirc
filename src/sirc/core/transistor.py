"""
SIRC Core Transistor Module.

Defines the abstract Transistor class and its NMOS and PMOS implementations. A
Transistor is a three-terminal digital switch with gate, source, and drain
Nodes. Transistors do not resolve logic or perform any electrical computation;
the Simulator evaluates each device's conduction state based on its gate value.
