SIRC Device Simulator Module.

Provides the DeviceSimulator class, responsible for evaluating a circuit
composed of Nodes, LogicDevices, and Transistors. The simulator performs
fixed-point iteration to resolve driver values, establish dynamic conduction
paths, and propagate LogicValues across connected node-groups.
